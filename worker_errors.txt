1. No Hostname Was Supplied Warning
    No hostname was supplied. Reverting to default 'localhost'
    This message is typically harmless but indicates that Celery is defaulting 
    to a generic hostname (localhost). If you're running the worker locally, 
    this warning can generally be ignored. However, for clarity and explicitness, 
    you can set the hostname explicitly when starting the worker.

    Solution: Use the --hostname flag to set a hostname explicitly:
    celery -A config worker --loglevel=info -E --hostname=worker1@%h

    - worker1 is the desired worker name.
    - %h is a placeholder that resolves to the machine's hostname.


4. Run the Celery Worker and Beat Scheduler
    Start the Celery worker and beat scheduler processes:

    Start the Celery worker:
    celery -A config worker --loglevel=info
    
    Start the Celery beat scheduler:
    celery -A config beat --loglevel=info
